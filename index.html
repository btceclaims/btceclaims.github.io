<u>1. Introduction to BTC-E Disputed Claims Group<br><br></u>

We are organizing users affected by BTC-E hackings, scams, frauds and malicious internal procedures and business practices. We provide advice as BTC-E often chooses to ignore claims at will and does not comply with the legacy legal requirements for claims settlements which applies to any exchange that handles both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, BTC-E does not comply with AML/KYC legislation which could make them vulnerable to lawsuits relating to money laundering.<br><br>

If you have a disputed claim with the BTC-E Bitcoin Exchange, please contact us and we will try to help you to get in contact and report your claim to the legacy regulators (see below). If possible, we can also try to arrange one or several class action lawsuits against these individuals and entities.<br><br>

The fastest way to get in touch with us is currently by  
<a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=401499;sa=summary">sending a private message to BTC-E Claims on Bitcointalk. </a> (Please note that you need a registered account on Bitcointalk.org to be able to send us a message. Sorry for the inconvenience but the e-mail addess previously listed here was receiving spam.)<br><br>

<u>2. BTC-E Known Facts - Please update information if available:</u><br><br>

BTC-E was, according to theguardian.com, operated by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/27/russian-criminal-mastermind-4bn-bitcoin-laundering-scheme-arrested-mt-gox-exchange-alexander-vinnik
">Alexander Vinnik who was arrested in the end of July</a>

Another BTC-E high profile is Alexey Demedov: <a target="_blank" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=23324">Alexey Demedov "Balthazar" (Bitcointalk.org)</a>. Alexey has been involved with BTC-E operations and is also the developer behind Novacoin which was launched at BTC-E and proclaimed by several external sources to be a scam.
Furthermore, he is associated with the Moscow based firm "RusBiTech"<br><br>

<u>3. BTC-E Fallacies</u><br><br>

First and foremost, BTC-E does not provide a proper claims service. They will frequently ignore your e-mails if you have a claim, there is no phone number, the messages you receive (if any) will be sent without names, there is no contact address and so on. According to our estimations and the contacts we have had with affected users there are currently hundreds or even more than a thousand unsettled claims that are being willfully ignored by BTC-E. BTC-E and its representatives are operating an exchange which handles legacy fiat currencies but without complying with the regulations that apply for these kind of  financial services.<br><br>

There are a number of ways you can loose all of your funds on BTC-E.<br><br>

It is possible to generate API keys without any e-mail confirmation requirements. These API keys can then be used to empty accounts without need for any e-mail confirmation. If an account is hacked the attacker can just generate API keys and then proceed by trading away funds on markets with low liquidity where another account will buy the cheap coins.<br><br>

<img src="gapi.png" width="90%"><br><br>

Even though the rest of the website is in English, the 2FA activation page suspiciously is in Russian only. It is possible that BTC-E consciously wants users not to activate the 2FA so that they can empty the account together with "third party hackers" and then blame the users for not activating the 2FA.<br><br>

<img src="2fai.jpg" width="90%"><br><br>

Even more suspiciously, when a user tries to activate the 2FA he or she will often receive an error message such as this, which further points in the direction of BTC-E alleviating inside jobs by maliciously retaining vulnerabilities in the platform.<br><br>
