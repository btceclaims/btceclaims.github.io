We are organizing users affected by BTC-E hackings, scams, frauds and malicious internal procedures and business practices. We provide advice as BTC-E often chooses to ignore claims at will and does not comply with the legal and legacy requirements for claims settlements which applies to any exchange that handles both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, BTC-E does not comply with AML/KYC legislation which could make them vulnerable to lawsuits relating to money laundering.<br><br>

If you have a disputed claim with the BTC-E Bitcoin Exchange, please contact us and we will try to help you to get in contact and report your claim to the legacy regulators (see below). If possible, we can also try to arrange one or several class action lawsuits against these individuals and entities.<br><br>

Fastest way to get in touch with us is here: <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=892034.0">BTC-E Disputed Claims @ Bitcointalk</a><br><br>
